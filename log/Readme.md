Changed root password for our "la de sempre" password.

Granted access to the raspberry via ssh configuring a port forwarding on the router, a dhcp for an static IP for the raspberry and using a DynDNS (noip.com), tomorrow I'll make some changes on the ssh service to make this access more secure, for now I'm shutting down the raspberry.

###Waiting for IP access.

Please, sort it ASAP.

As soon as we have all 3 raspberrys working with docker swarm, we will start to develop our web service.

Our objective is to have it running at the end of march.

###Definition of the project

Finally we decided that we are going to use docker swarm instead of pacemaker or any other cluster software.
